# Social-Distancing using Client Server

Due to the Covid-19 sanitary rules, people have to keep meter apart from each other.
The project aim to calculate distance between people using [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ "Named link title") implementation of Yolo-v3 Object Detection.  
  My client side convert my video into frames to send it to the server. This one will keep all the 'persons' objects box, calculate Euclidean distance between all centroid box, and finally return the safe persons and too close people.
  
  **Will update the code soon**
